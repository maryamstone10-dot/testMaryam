# TeachableMachine

This is a GitHub Repository for using Teachable Machine with StreamLit cloud. 

You will need to add two files: 
labels.txt 
keras_model.h5 

These are the two outputs from exporting a teachable machine image recognition model, as a Tensorflow Keras model. 

Once you have cloned this repo and added the two files, you can create an app from it on https://streamlit.io/cloud
